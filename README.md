# Temperature Scheduling Documentation

## Requirements
python3

```python
pip install numpy==1.17.4 
python -m pip install "dask[delayed]"
```

## Running the code

```python
python src/main.py
```

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

* Mutation is done by Permutation
* Offspring is generated by Tournament Selection
* Crossover is done by using Single Point Crossover

All methods are in `ga_functions.py` file.

## Changing Parameters

The parameters can be changed in the `main.py` file.
Default parameters:
```python
Vmax, Vhigh, Vlow, Vmin = 5, 4, 0, -1 # Temperature parameters
V0 = 0 # Initial temperature
K = 2 # Number of heaters
Tmax = 7 # Total time

PiP = np.array([50.0, 50.0]) # Penalty Cost for each Temperature danger zone
PiC = np.array([0.0, 10.0, 20.0]) # Continuous cost for each mode
PiD = np.array([0.0, 30.0, 10.0]) # Discrete cost for each mode when changing to this mode
A = np.array([-4.0, 4.0/3.0, 2.0]) # Heating parameters

# Genetic Algorithm Parameters
pop_size = 1000
mutation_rate = 0.2
crossover_rate = 0.6
tour = 0.2
generations = 10
runs = 50 # If you want to run the entire genetic algorith many times, usually this ensures that you have good solutions and that the GA is stable
```
